The document is mostly unreadable due to the faintness of the text, and it appears to be rotated. However, here's an attempt to transcribe any visible parts:

```
[...]
Manuel [...] 
Carmoneda del Sr.
Luis Ollibina de Leo[n]
Oficialm. de lo Gr.
```

If you can provide a clearer or different angle of the document, I could try to provide a more accurate transcription.
